# Computer Vision 2 Assignments
This repository contains the assignments for the course Computer Vision 2 from University of Amsterdam (spring 2019 edition). <br/>
It contains 3 parts:
- Assignment 1: Iterative Closest Point (ICP)

Assignment 1 Data: The data folder cannot be uploaded to git, so it should be placed in assignment_1/data <br/>
Assignment 1 Results: In order to reproduce the results, we have provided to demo files, demo_icp.py and demo_merge_scene.py. The merge scene demo can be run as is, while the IPC demo can be run by modifying the ICP initial hyper parameters for sampling (the default is 'all' and 'all').
